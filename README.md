The analysis showed that the math scores for charter schools is higher than public schools for all grades except for grade 12, additional analysis to see if the same trend holds true for reading scores would be worthwhile.

The analysis also lists the number of students for each high school in desending order, adding their schools budgets to that and see if there's any relationship between more students and a higher budget would be worthwhile.

The describe function in deliverable 3.1 showed that the mean and median of math scores were lower than the reading scores, however in 4.2 the list showed that Sullivan High School had a much higher math score than reading score average, it would be worthwhile to see if any other schools has a similar result.

Any analysis to see if there's any correlation between school budget and average math and reading scores would also be worthwhile.
